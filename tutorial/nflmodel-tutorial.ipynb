    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook describes the `nflmodel` Python package which can be used to predict the full probability distribution of NFL point-spread and point-total outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is inspired by the Elo based sports analytics work at [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) and makes use of a machine learning algorithm that I developed called the [margin-dependent Elo (MELO)](https://github.com/morelandjs/melo) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I describe the theory behind the algorithm at length in an [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00527), and you can also read about it on the [MELO sphinx documentation](https://moreland.dev/projects/melo/) page. The purpose of the blog post is not to rehash the theory behind the model, but rather to demonstrate how it can be used effectively in practice."

    "\n",

CLE's predicted win probability is 68%, their predicted point spread is -12.6 points, and their predicted point total is 44.2 points (according to the model). This would correspond to a characteristic final score of 28-16 CLE over MIA with fairly large uncertainties.\n",

    "\n",
    "The over/under metrics are reported in a similar fashion. The model thinks there's a 55% chance the total score goes under the published Vegas line which is good for a 4% return on average. Similarly, taking the over is expected to net a 13% loss.\n",

    "#### Quarterback changes\n",
    "\n",
    "While it has not been readily apparent up to this point, the model accounts for changes at the quarterback position. It does this by tracking ratings at both the team and quarterback level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose Tom Brady were the only quarterback that ever played for the Patriots. Then there would be two associated ratings, one for T.Brady and one for NE, which are effectively identical. If however, Tom Brady left NE and went to play for SF for the last two years of his career, his rating would diverge from NE's rating and begin to track the performance of SF.\n",
    "\n",
    "I take the weighted average of QB level and team level ratings when generating the effective rating for each upcoming game. In this way, I mix together the historical performance of the team with its QB. The weighted average is controlled by the `qb_weight` hyperparameter which is fixed when calibrating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has no direct knowledge of QB injuries, so you'll have to explicitly tell the model to generate predictions with a different quarterback if that's what you intend to do. At the moment, the only runner that can accommodate QB injuries is the `nflmodel predict` runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, you want to see how CLE would perform on the road against PHI on 2019-12-01 if Carson Wentz went out with an injury practicing before the game. First let's see how the two teams would matchup if Wentz never got hurt. "

    "\n",
    "I've also bundled a small script `nflmodel/tutorial/simulate-bets.py` inside the tutorial directory which can simulate the performance of the model as a betting tool on historical games. Hereafter, I restrict my attention to point spreads since I'm currently neglecting many factors which are specifically important to point total values like stadium type and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is as follows. I backtest the model and estimate the probability that the home team and away team each cover their Vegas spread (scraped from covers.com) at the moment just before kickoff. If the model believes that either team will cover their spread with a likelihood greater than X, where X is a fixed decision threshold, then I place a simulated bet on that team.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the threshold X=50%, the simulation places bets on every game, and when the threshold X ≫ 50%, the simulation is far more selective with the games it chooses to bet on. If I set the decision threshold X > 90% then the model cannot find any games with sufficiently high confidence to bet on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, one expects the model to get more bets correct when X is large because it is more confident in those bets. The goal here is to see if there is a threshold X which is sufficiently large to yield a positive ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, I need more information to compute the model's ROI than just the historical spread. I also need the vigorish or \"juice\" on each spread which is the cut taken by the house in order to place a bet. Typically this ranges anywhere from -100 to -120 for spread bets, which means you might need to risk up to 120 dollars in order to win 100 dollars. More extreme vigs exist but they are uncommon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, **I do not have the historical vigs for these lines**, precluding a true ROI simulation. However, you can rest assured that the ROI will be strongly negative if the model is not getting more games right than wrong. So for now, let's just see if I can demonstrate that the model is better than 50-50 _with statistical significance_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance here is key. As I increase the betting threshold, I reduce my validation statistics because the number of qualifying games drops. For large values of the threshold X, the model may only find a dozen or so qualifying games to bet on. This means the results of the simulation will be noisy and it will be possible to be duped by statistical fluctuations (we've all seen someone flip four heads in a row).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate statistical significance, I compute the 90% interquartile range for the null model, i.e. the range of reasonable outcomes for independent random wins sampled with 50% probability. In other words, I compare my model's success rate to what one would expect from random chance.\n",
